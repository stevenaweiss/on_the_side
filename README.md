#On The Side 

##GA WDI NYC Jan 14, project 1

A curated list of unexpected appetizers and side dishes to order right now, searchable by New York neighborhood.  


New York has always been a culinary destination.  More than the traditional "any type of takeout at any hour," the city is setting the pace for new and exciting dishes in America.  Too often, the delicious and unique menu items go overlooked, in favor of getting right to the main course.  Take some time.  Through "On The Side" we explore and celebrate these dishes, through our favorite ingredients at the moment. We hope to be a trusted source in expanding your culinary horizons.
